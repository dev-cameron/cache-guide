### cache-control: max-age
### Keeps your content cached, as long as it's _fresh_

**max-age=N**: this means the response data remains fresh until **N** seconds after it’s generated. Note: “*generated*” refers to when the origin server generated the response. 
If there are additional layers between the origin server where the response was generated, and the destination client, `Age` will be increased for the time the response spent at each step (which is viewable on the `Age` header)

**Fresh** means that a responses **age** has not exceeded it’s **freshness lifetime**. If you prefer seeing a formula, enjoy this formula:
```js
response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime > current_age) 
```

So if your browser cache receives a response with a header `max-age=600`, it means your browser cache is allowed to serve the cached data until that reponse is 10 minutes old. 

( For even more specific spec, see [RFC,  9111: HTTP Caching (rfc-editor.org)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-freshness) )
