# What does it mean?  

response remains fresh until N seconds after it’s generated. Note “generated” refers to when the origin server generated the response. if there are interim layers that store the response, that time is added (on Age response)


[RFC 9111: HTTP Caching (rfc-editor.org)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-freshness)


Fresh = responses **age** has not exceeded it’s **freshness lifetime**


Per RFC, `response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime > current_age)`  


> **Good to know**: `<a>` tag attributes such as `className` or `target="_blank"` can be added to `<Link>` as props and will be passed to the underlying `<a>` element.


I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  

Some `backticks` for inline.

```js
backtick.fences('for blocks')
```
