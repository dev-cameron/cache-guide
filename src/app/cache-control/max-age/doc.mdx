**max-age=N**: means the response data remains fresh until N seconds after it’s generated. Note “generated” refers to when the origin server generated the response. 
If there are additional layers between the origin server where the response was generated, and the destination client, Age will be increased for the time the response spent at each step (on the **Age** header)

**Fresh** = responses **age** has not exceeded it’s **freshness lifetime**

```js
response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime > current_age) 
```
