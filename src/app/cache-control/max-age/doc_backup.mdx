**max-age=N**: this means the response data remains fresh until **N** seconds after it’s generated. _(Note: “*generated*” refers to when the origin server generated the response)_ 

>Note: If there are additional layers between the origin server where the response was generated and the destination client, the `Age` header will be returned with the response, representing the time the response spent at each step.

>An `Age` header value of 0 typically indicates content was retrieved directly from the origin server.

So if your browser cache receives a response with a header `max-age=600`, it means that the cached data is **fresh** until that data is 10 minutes old. 

**Fresh** means that a responses `current-age` has not exceeded it’s `freshness-lifetime`, which in this case is the 600ms value we assigned to `max-age`. If you prefer seeing a formula, enjoy this formula:
```js
response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime > current_age) 
```

( For even more specific spec, see [RFC,  9111: HTTP Caching (rfc-editor.org)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-freshness) )
